# SAML11-COS

SAML1.1 Token for Catalan HealthCare Authorities from InterSystems IRIS ObjectScript.

# What is included?

It includes just the standard IRIS classes related to SAML modified to allow SAML 1.1. 

# What is not included?

It does not include any kind of usage by itself. Each integration which needs SAML 1.1 must use these classes in their specific way but it is not included in this repository.
